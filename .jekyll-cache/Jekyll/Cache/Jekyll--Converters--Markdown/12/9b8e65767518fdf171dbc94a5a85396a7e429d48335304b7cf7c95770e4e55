I"ä<p>Koszegi and Rabin (2006) show that workers with endogenous income targets
respond differently to anticipated changes and unanticipated shocks in their 
earnings, and only the latter generates behaviors that contradict the 
neoclassical model of labor supply. In this paper, we study the impact 
of booking cancellations and passenger no-showsâ€”a source of unanticipated
negative income shocksâ€”on Singaporean taxi driversâ€™ labor supply and 
productivity. We find that drivers work longer and earn more per hour 
following cancellations or no-shows, and the effects are strongest when 
cumulative income is close to the average shift income and become 
insignificant when the income is too low or too high. This provides 
compelling evidence for income targeting labor supply, even in the presence 
of endogenous reference point. In addition, we find that drivers respond 
more strongly to more recent cancellations and no-shows, suggesting a 
dynamic nature of the reference point. Moreover, working longer and 
increasing productivity are substitutable rather than complementary 
devices, and are chosen by taxi drivers in their own favor: More 
experienced drivers tend to increase productivity, and solo drivers 
tend to work more hours.</p>
