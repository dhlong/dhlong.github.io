I"à<p>The paper investigates the influence of fuel-price and fuel-economy 
regulation on the adoption of fuel-saving technologies in the U.S. 
automobile industry. I address this question with an empirical model 
of the industry that incorporates demand, supply, technologies, and 
regulations. The novelty of this model is that it allows for endogenous 
choices of vehicle fuel efficiency by firms in the form of a 
fuel-efficiency frontier. The counterfactual studies show that both 
fuel prices and regulations contribute to the recent acceleration of 
vehicle fuel economy in the U.S.: Consumers are driven by the fluctuation 
in fuel price and car-makers are driven by stricter regulations when 
adopting fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>
