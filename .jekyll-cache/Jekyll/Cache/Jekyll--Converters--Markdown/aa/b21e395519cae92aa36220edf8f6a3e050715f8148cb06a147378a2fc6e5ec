I"’<p>The paper investigates the effect of price salience on consumer fuel 
choice at the pump. Using data gathered from an experiment conducted 
in four Brazilian cities which involved showing salient price information 
to random consumers at fueling stations, we show that the observed 
consumer choices are consistent with a model of imperfect price 
information. Price noise is estimated to contribute at least 19% of 
the variation in consumerâ€™s random utility. Providing price ratio 
comparison at the pump can decrease consumerâ€™s perceived value of 
gasoline and midgrade gasoline by 7%. The model also shows a significant 
value of gasoline to consumers even when ethanol is very competitively 
priced, as well as substantial variation in gasoline valuation across 
consumers, which highlights the difficulties in displacing fossil fuel, 
even in a market with an accessible alternative as in Brazil.</p>
