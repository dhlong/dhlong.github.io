    - title: "Making Lemonade from Lemons: Taxi Drivers' Response to Cancellations and No-shows *(job market paper, link to [PDF](!SITE_URL/doc/jmp.pdf))*"
      author: Hai Long Duong, Junhong Chu and Dai Yao
      ssrn: https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3342473
      summary: |
        Koszegi and Rabin (2006) show that workers with endogenous income targets
        respond differently to anticipated changes and unanticipated shocks in their 
        earnings, and only the latter generates behaviors that contradict the 
        neoclassical model of labor supply. In this paper, we study the impact 
        of booking cancellations and passenger no-shows—a source of unanticipated
        negative income shocks—on Singaporean taxi drivers' labor supply and 
        productivity. We find that drivers work longer and earn more per hour 
        following cancellations or no-shows, and the effects are strongest when 
        cumulative income is close to the average shift income and become 
        insignificant when the income is too low or too high. This provides 
        compelling evidence for income targeting labor supply, even in the presence 
        of endogenous reference point. In addition, we find that drivers respond 
        more strongly to more recent cancellations and no-shows, suggesting a 
        dynamic nature of the reference point. Moreover, working longer and 
        increasing productivity are substitutable rather than complementary 
        devices, and are chosen by taxi drivers in their own favor: More 
        experienced drivers tend to increase productivity, and solo drivers 
        tend to work more hours. 
      
    - title: "Price Salience and Imperfect Information: Evidences from Experiments at Fuelling Stations in Brazil"
      author: Hai Long Duong and Alberto Salvo
      summary: |
        The paper investigates the effect of price salience on consumer fuel 
        choice at the pump. Using data gathered from an experiment conducted 
        in four Brazilian cities which involved showing salient price information 
        to random consumers at fueling stations, we show that the observed 
        consumer choices are consistent with a model of imperfect price 
        information. Price noise is estimated to contribute at least 19% of 
        the variation in consumer's random utility. Providing price ratio 
        comparison at the pump can decrease consumer's perceived value of 
        gasoline and midgrade gasoline by 7%. The model also shows a significant 
        value of gasoline to consumers even when ethanol is very competitively 
        priced, as well as substantial variation in gasoline valuation across 
        consumers, which highlights the difficulties in displacing fossil fuel, 
        even in a market with an accessible alternative as in Brazil. 
      
    - title: "The Adoption of Fuel-saving Technologies in U.S. Automobile Industry: Regulation Push and Demand Pull *(link to [PDF](!SITE_URL/doc/mpg.pdf))*"
      author: Hai Long Duong
      summary: |
        The paper investigates the influence of fuel-price and fuel-economy 
        regulation on the adoption of fuel-saving technologies in the U.S. 
        automobile industry. I address this question with an empirical model 
        of the industry that incorporates demand, supply, technologies, and 
        regulations. The novelty of this model is that it allows for endogenous 
        choices of vehicle fuel efficiency by firms in the form of a 
        fuel-efficiency frontier. The counterfactual studies show that both 
        fuel prices and regulations contribute to the recent acceleration of 
        vehicle fuel economy in the U.S.: Consumers are driven by the fluctuation 
        in fuel price and car-makers are driven by stricter regulations when 
        adopting fuel-efficient vehicles.
